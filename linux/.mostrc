% This is an example configuration file that provides a `less' emulation 
% for MOST.
%
% The format is simple: 
%       setkey <function-name> <key-name>
%       unsetkey <key-name>
%       color <object-name> <fg> <bg>
%
% Here <key-name> must be enclosed in double quotes.  '^' represents Ctrl.
% The function name is not in double quotes.
% 
%
% When MOST starts up, it looks for a keymap file given by the environment 
% variable MOST_INITFILE.  If that environment variable does not exist, 
% MOST will look in the users HOME directory for .mostrc on Unix systems
% and MOST.RC on VMS systems.
%
% The file `most.rc' contains a listing of the default MOST keybindings.
