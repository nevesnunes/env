.SH "NAME"
dosbox_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the dosbox processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the dosbox processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The dosbox processes execute with the dosbox_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep dosbox_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The dosbox_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBdosbox_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the dosbox_t domain are the following:

/usr/bin/dosbox, /usr/bin/dosbox
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux dosbox policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dosbox processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for dosbox:

.EX
.B dosbox_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a dosbox_t
can be used to make the process type dosbox_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  dosbox policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run dosbox with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd server, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean. Disabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow all domains to execute in fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P fips_mode 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow system to run with NIS, you must turn on the nis_enabled boolean. Disabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P nis_enabled 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to use nscd shared memory, you must turn on the nscd_use_shm boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P nscd_use_shm 1

.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux dosbox policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dosbox processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.I The following file types are defined for dosbox:


.EX
.PP
.B dosbox_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the dosbox_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the dosbox_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/usr/bin/dosbox, /usr/bin/dosbox

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
