 OpenSuse: Cannot map Low Memory Globals: Permission denied.
Due to a change in how programs in Linux are allowed to use memory, before using SheepShaver you need to set a variable in the file /etc/sysctl.conf. Add this line: vm.mmap_min_addr = 0
and do as root:
echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr

In addition to this general issue, for OpenSuse to run SheepShaver, you need to disable Novell AppArmor. You can do this by entering the startup parameter “apparmor=0” at boot (at every boot) or choose a more permanent solution by using Yast2 and set the apparmor service to not start at all.

Ubuntu 11.04 32 bit: Compile the sheep_net driver
Goto SheepShaver/src/Unix/Linux/Netdriver and enter
“make”,
“sudo make install”,
“sudo chown “yourusername” /dev/sheep_net”
Use the sheep_net driver:
“sudo modprobe sheep_net”
