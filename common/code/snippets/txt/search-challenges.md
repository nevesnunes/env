1. Intranets: internal documents, typically in different modalities (FAQs, support cases, wikis, public pages) and across diverse storages that evolved throughout the years via acquisitions and osmosis.

2. Clustering: you don't have any keywords, but rather want to find how a particular document (legal template, its clause section) evolved over time. You want to avoid using keywords. Search for similar documents or document sections. Find similarity between two documents that is based on semantics rather than query keywords. Applications: eDiscovery, contract managementâ€¦

3. SME & Intent: "relevant result" means different things in different domains, or even different aspects of a single domain. Google is doing an amazing job with their "single search box", but there are industries (for example, HR) where search precision matters much more than recall. More elaborate, focused, domain-specific facets or even dialogue systems make sense there.
