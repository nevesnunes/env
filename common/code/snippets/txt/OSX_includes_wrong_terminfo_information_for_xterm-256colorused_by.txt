OSX includes wrong terminfo information for xterm-256color(used by iterm), it sets the backspace key description to ctrl+h, which results in libvterm/nvim parsing it as backspace.

My guess is that most programs parse ctrl+h correctly because they ignore the kbs description. One way to work around the problem is to fix the terminfo entry for your terminal by replacing kbs=^H by kbs=\177(ascii del). These commands will create a fixed terminfo entry in your HOME directory:

infocmp $TERM | sed 's/kbs=^[hH]/kbs=\\177/' > $TERM.ti
tic $TERM.ti
