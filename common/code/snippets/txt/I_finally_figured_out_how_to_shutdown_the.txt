I finally figured out how to shutdown the guest from the command line. In case anyone else is interested I will explain quickly how it can be done.
1. Start the VM from the web interface
2. Open the paster.log file (~/convirt/paster.log)
3. Go to the end of the log file and look for a line starting with CMDLINE ***** and copy everything on that line after it (mine starts with kvm.....)
4. That line you just copied should be the command to start the guest. You can test this by shutting down the guest and running this command
5. Look through that line you just copied for the -monitor section. Copy the text between unix: and the first ,
Mine was -monitor "unix:/var/run/kvm/monitors/guestname,server,nowait" so the text i copy is /var/run/kvm/monitors/guestname
6. The shutdown command is as follows:
echo 'system_powerdown' |socat - unix-connect:/var/run/kvm/monitors/guestname >/dev/null

Other commands, like keystrokes, can also be sent as follows:
echo 'sendkey ctrl-alt-delete' |socat - unix-connect:/var/run/kvm/monitors/guestname >/dev/null
