EDIT #2

Create a fifo in your home directory:

$ mkfifo ~/tata

at the end of your job:

echo "it's done" > ~/tata

at the start of the other job (the one who is waiting):

cat ~/tata 

It's not polling it is old good blocking IO.
EDIT #3

Using signals:

At the begin of the script(s) who is(are) waiting :

echo $$ >>~/WeAreStopped
kill -STOP $$

at the end of your long job :

if [[ -f ~/WeAreStopped ]] ; then
    xargs kill -CONT < ~/WeAreStopped
    rm ~/WeAreStopped
fi
