Create a .deadman file in your home directory. This file needs to be updated periodically (I added touch ~/.deadman to my .bashrc file).

touch ~/.deadman

Create a .deadman-actions script in your home directory to execute whatever commands you want. Make sure it's executable.

#!/bin/bash

# Do whatever you want here, like disable the firewall, update dyndns, delete (or shred) browser profile directories, etc.

# Update ~/.deadman to prevent cron from running this script again for a while  
touch ~/.deadman

Set up a cron job to periodically check .deadman and execute the .deadman-actions script if .deadman hasn't been updated recently:

*/15 * * * * find ~/ -maxdepth 1 -type f -name .deadman -ctime +3 -exec ~/.deadman-actions \; >/dev/null 2>&1
