Anyone who knows only tiny bit of Unix takes 10 minutes tops for the first time, all you need to know is really that pacstrap ROOTPOINT base base-devel extracts the root filesystem which includes a kernel image and boot partition mind you onto there. The rest is just basic shit on formatting block devices, how to set up a boot loader, how fstab works, and basic system recovery crap from a chroot. They even have an arch-chroot command which automatically mounts the virtual filesystems inside the chroot for you so you don't have to mount -t proc /tmp/arch-root/proc and similar stuff.
