The issue is apparently that tmux does not pass through all escape codes to the underlying terminal, but interprets them for itself. This article describes this. It also provides a solution. Wrapping the escape string in \ePtmux;\e and \e\ will tell tmux to just pass the escape codes straight through.

So,

sitm=\E[3m, ritm=\E[23m,

becomes

sitm=\ePtmux;\e\E[3m\e\\, ritm=\ePtmux;\e\E[23m\e\\,

Here is the full resulting tmux-256color-italic file:

# A xterm-256color based TERMINFO that adds the escape sequences for italic.
#
# Install:
#
#   tic xterm-256color-italic.terminfo
#
# Usage:
#
#   export TERM=xterm-256color-italic
#
tmux-256color-italic|tmux with 256 colors and italic,
        sitm=\ePtmux;\e\E[3m\e\\, ritm=\ePtmux;\e\E[23m\e\\,
                use=screen-256color,

Save this and then run

tic tmux-256color-italic

and we're good to go!

All that remains is to tell tmux to use this new terminfo file, in .tmux.conf:

set-option -g default-terminal "tmux-256color-italic"

And now the italic escape codes get passed straight through tmux to the underlying terminal, meaning that we get italic text inside it.
