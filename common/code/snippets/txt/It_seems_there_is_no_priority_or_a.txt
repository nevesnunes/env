It seems there is no priority or a single setting point to set which freedesktop notification daemon to run. I got such problem with XFCE installed on Ubuntu 14.04.

Unity notification launch xfce4-notifyd as it was the default.

    Check for available notification services, example:

    $ grep -r org.freedesktop.Notifications /usr/share/dbus-1/services/
    /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.xfce.xfce4-notifyd.Notifications.service:Name=org.freedesktop.Notifications
    /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service:Name=org.freedesktop.Notifications

    Disable non needed ones, leave only the one you want:

    sudo mv /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.xfce.xfce4-notifyd.Notifications.service /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.xfce.xfce4-notifyd.Notifications.service.disable

    pkill xfce4-notifyd

    Check

    notify-send test
