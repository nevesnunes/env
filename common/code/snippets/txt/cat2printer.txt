scan your subnet like:

nmap 10.1.1.*

Then when you find something on some of the common printer ports (I think 9100 is one off the top of my head, but nmap will identify them for you):

cat my_document.txt | nc $whatever_ip_address_you_found $printer_port

I'm not sure this is helpful, or even useful, but it will usually work. Older printers might require you to convert say a pdf to postscript first. You're going to miss out on anything like scaling, duplex, etc.

If your requirements are as simple as "I want this text on paper" though, and you're on Linux (or bsd, osx, plan9, etc.), it should mostly work. You could even put a function in your shell configuration, something like:

print(){  cat $1 | nc $office_printer 9100 }

So on the shell, you can do:

print /path/to/list_of_annoying_users.pdf
