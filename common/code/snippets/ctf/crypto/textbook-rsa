(e,m)
(d,p,q) p.q=m, e.d=1 mod phi(m)

Enc
x^e mod m
y^d = (x^e)^d = x mod m
(2x)^e = 2^e x^e

Sig
x^d mod m
y^e = (x^d)^e = x
(2x)^d = 2^d x^d

# Problem
We want
a => a^d
We can only have
b => b^d

### one way
1st send
(xa)^d = x^d a^d
2nd send
(x)^d = x^d

((x^d)^-1) mod m
We need to pick an x that x^d has an inverse

### another way
x = 2^e
we send 2^e
(xa)^d = (2^e a)^d = 2^ed a^d = 2 a^d
