Convert PCF and BDF files to bitmap only OpenType (.otb) using fontforge

If you have a new enough fontforge, the python version of this script can
optionally read filenames from standard input, generating multiple .otb
font files as it finds new families.  It also handles gzipped PCF and BDF
files.
