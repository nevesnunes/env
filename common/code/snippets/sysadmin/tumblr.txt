    for a data dump: urllib will return a string of the page you want
    looking for a specific section in the html: lxml is pretty good
    looking for something in unruly html: definitely beautifulsoup
    looking for a specific item in a section: beautifulsoup, lxml, text parsing is what you need.
    need to put the data in a database/file: use scrapy

    wget --recursive --domains=ronbarak.tumblr.com --include-directories=notes \
    http://ronbarak.tumblr.com/notes/40692813320/4Y70Zzacy
    
    
    
    For me it doesn’t display the static link, but you can get the next URL by looking at the source code: the onclick attribute of the a element contains

    […] tumblrReq.open('GET','/notes/64967405021/2nsoCKZ8N?from_c=1382486492',true); […]

The /notes/64967405021/2nsoCKZ8N?from_c=1382486492 part is the URL path of the next page of notes.

Howto:

    open the source code of a notes page (in Firefox with Ctrl+u)
    search for /notes/ (in Firefox with Ctrfl+f)
    copy the whole string enclosed in the two ', beginning with /notes/ and ending with a number
    append this string at your Tumblr domain: http://uri-hyukkie.tumblr.com + paste the string
    open this page in your browser; and repeat
