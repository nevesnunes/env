sendkey can be used to send keys to the virtual system that your host intercepts at low level - such as Ctrl + Alt + F*.

    Use Ctrl + Alt + 2 to switch to the QEMU console.
    Type sendkey ctrl-alt-f1 and press Enter.
    Use Ctrl + Alt + 1 to switch back to the virtual system, which should now by at TTY1.

Once at a virtual terminal, you should be able to use the chvt command, e.g. sudo chvt 7 to go back to your X session.
