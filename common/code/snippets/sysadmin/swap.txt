To create a swap partition after installation, create an empty partition that should have no holes. You can then format this partition with:

sudo mkswap /dev/sdX

replacing /dex/sdX with your partition. Mount this partition as swap with

sudo swapon -U UUID

where UUID is that of your /dev/sdX as read from this:

blkid /dev/sdX

Bind your new swap in /etc/fstab by adding this line:

UUID=xxx    none    swap    sw      0   0
