Improving boot performance is something where one could write alot about the topic. As far as disabling services goes, unfortunately only you can tell if you need a certain service or if you want to have a certain service.

Do you use bluetooth devices? If not, mask bluetooth.service

Do you use a 3G/UMTS etc device to connect to the internet? If you don't mask ModemManager.service

Are you using your computer behind a modern router at home? Get rid of firewalld.service

Do you use any lvm or raid? If you want fast boot times, you shouldn't, so you can disable all the lvm2- * and dmraid-activation.service and systemd-udev-settle.service

Also who needs the automatic bug report tool? Mask abrt-ccpp.service, abrt-oops.service, abrt-vmcore.service, abrt-xorg.service, abrtd.service

systemd-firstboot.service can also be masked

If you don't use a tablet or some other device which needs to adjust screen rotation and brightness with the help of sensors, mask iio-sensor-proxy.service

Personally I also boot without all the fedora- * services, without avahi, without plymouth (kernel parameter plymouth.enable=0, mask all plymouth services), without dev-hugepages.mount, dev-mqueue.mount, sys-fs-fuse-connections.mount, sys-kernel-debug.mount

Check if you can enable some "Fast Boot" option in your BIOS, usually you loose a lot of time there.

#

If you need to speed it up, disable abrtd and libvirtd, and replace firewalld with iptables. And train to type your passphrase faster, since that time is included in your 2 minute boot time, too. Finally, you could build an initrd with only just the modules you really need, which should gain you some time, too.
