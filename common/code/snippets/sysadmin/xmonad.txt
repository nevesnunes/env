I'm going to answer my own question! The layout is fairly easy to produce using XMonad.Layout.LayoutBuilder. Here's a barebones implementation:

layoutN 1 (relBox 0 0 0.5 1) (Just $ relBox 0 0 1 1) Full
$ layoutN 1 (relBox 0.5 0 1 0.5) (Just $ relBox 0.5 0 1 1) Full 
$ layoutAll (relBox 0.5 0.5 1 1) simpleTabbed

This behaves almost exactly the way I was hoping. There are two shortcomings:

    You can't increase or decrease the number of windows in the master pane, and
    You can't change the master pane size dynamically.

I think those issues could probably be addressed by creating a layout that handles Shrink, Expand, and IncMasterM messages to generate new LayoutBuilder layouts like the above. When I have time (maybe next weekend) I'll probably try to implement that.
