=== EASILY INSTALL CHROME ON FEDORA 22 ===

For some reason, Google Chrome is kind of a pain in the butt to install on 
Fedora, and then another pain in the butt to make it not have two icons in your 
dock. Let's fix that. Just open a Terminal (no, you don't need to be root) and 
paste these lines in to get pain-free Google Chrome. After you run this, press 
Alt+F2 and type "r" to make GNOME update.


cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/google-chrome.repo
[google-chrome]
name=google-chrome - \$basearch
baseurl=http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/rpm/stable/\$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub
EOF
sudo yum install google-chrome-stable
sudo sed -i.bak '/\[Desktop Entry\]/a StartupWMClass=Google-chrome-stable' /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop


=== CURIOUS? HERE'S HOW THESE COMMANDS WORK ===

If you're curious, here's an explanation. The first 8 lines add the official 
Google Chrome repository to Yum's list of repositories. The penultimate line 
then installs Google Chrome using Yum. The last line edits Chrome's .desktop 
file (which is the file that adds Google Chrome to your application launcher) 
to fix an issue where Chrome would launch as "Google-chrome-stable" and you'd 
have two different icons in your dock and it just looked silly.
