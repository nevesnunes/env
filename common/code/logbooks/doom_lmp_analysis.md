 Firstly, you can use -recordfromto demo1 demo2 in prb+ and then press the join key (Q by default). No save tics, no pause tics at all (you won't need to press them, will you?).

Secondly, rerecording and slow-motion are not the best tools for Doom TASing. The Doom movies submitted to TASVideos by Akse and ClumsyDoomer all use frame-by-frame demo editing with XDRE
