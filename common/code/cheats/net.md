IPSEC gives you kerberos authentication out of the gate. Use it. Build AD groups for your tier 0/tier 1 administrators and machines.
Enforce bastion hosts with MFA.
Use ASR for neutering WMI calls. 
Available in GPO and MEM, auditing exists.

            IP, Port - from host that holds the private key used to decrypt the data and serves the certificate (i.e. the decrypting host, the server)
            Protocol - upper-layer protocol encrypted by SSL/TLS, e.g. the protocol encrypted over a HTTPS connection is HTTP
            SSL debug file = C:\Temp\ssl_debug.txt
        :( If a Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) or RSA ephemeral cipher suite is used, the RSA keys are only used to secure the DH or RSA exchange, not encrypt the data.
            Cipher Suite = TLS_DHE, SSL_DHE
            ServerKeyMessage
        :( Capture must include SSL/TLS session establishment
            Server sends certificate
            SSL debug file = `ssl_restore_session canâ€™t find stored session`

    Subject = Server FQDN
    Subject Alternative Name = Server DNS FQDN
