    Please reinstall Message Analyzer to correct the problem. If the PEF-WFP-MessageProvider continues to fail, you may have a conflict with a third party filter driver or your computer might have reached the maximum number of drivers allowed, for example, on a Windows 7 machine. To resolve this issue, you can try increasing the filter driver limit in the registry.
