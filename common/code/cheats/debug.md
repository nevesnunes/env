    - validating parts vs whole
        > you may think of other things you can do with that exploit (ex: instead of RCE just leaking application secrets that can forge a cookie).  Or even just simplifying the exploit and instead of using it to get code execution, try putting in a sleep, DNS request, echo, etc to verify at least a piece of the exploit works. [...] you’ll see me do a bunch of enumeration from the exploit such as leaking java/OS version and environment variables which would have confirmed why the Remote Class Loading wasn’t working. The enumeration is simple, its just putting ${java:version} in the URL

    - avoid watchpoint hits by patching-out instructions
        > - Using the Project64 debugger to set watchpoints on reads or writes to the controller state memory was fruitless because they were constantly triggered by code that I assume was generic system-level code checking and updating the controller state every frame.
        > - Instead I tried a more indirect approach with memory scanning on the Gallery menu. First I tracked down the location of the current button index with the standard technique of repeatedly updating the selection and then scanning memory for the newly changed value. Then I could set read watchpoints on the button index value to see if I could identify where the menu handling code was.
        > - Initially this also caused the watchpoint to trigger repeatedly. By patching out the read instruction that was repeatedly triggered, I saw it was caused by the glowing orange cursor that shows above the currently selected button. After removing that read instruction I got much more useful results: the watchpoint triggered when the menu description text for the currently selected button was changed, and when I pressed A to trigger the currently selected button.

        > - If there’s a piece of code that’s not doing what you expect, add a loop around it whose condition is a variable that can be modified by the debugger. The resulting binary can be effectively unchanged such that the loop executes once, but if a debugger is present and you see the strange behavior, you can go back and step through it. 1a. This can also be done by modifying the instruction pointer, but that requires restoring register state. I do this too but it’s more tricky.
        > - The unused portion of the stack often contains clues about what happened recently.
        > - Break on access (ba in WinDbg) uses CPU registers to break on a memory address when it’s used. This is wonderful for tracking how state moves across a system, or tracking when locks are acquired and released, etc.
        > - Using breakpoints with conditions allows things like breaking on a common thing, like opening a file, printing out the state of the operation, and resuming execution, allowing interesting conditions to be logged.
        > - Altering thread priorities in the debugger is one way to promote the code you’re trying to look at and/or demote code that’s interfering with you.
        > - If you have a race condition, thoughtfully adding sleep in the right place can provoke it allowing it to be debugged and understood.
        > - If code aborts in ways you don’t expect, add a breakpoint to the exception filter (which decides which handlers to execute.) This executes when the full stack that caused the exception to be raised is present.
        > - Further to the previous comments about patching code, if you’re stepping through code and a branch goes somewhere you don’t want, change the instruction pointer. If you want that branch to happen again, change the condition jump to an unconditional jump.
        > - In WinDbg, dps on import tables or import table entries to show where indirect calls will go. This is useful when something else is trying to hijack your code.
        > - Keep an in memory circular log of interesting cases in your code. This log often doesn’t need to be big, and doesn’t need to allocate on insert, but if something bad happens in your code you can dump the interesting cases that were hit recently.

In other words, you have something tangible to work from. Furthermore, those tangible inputs probably came from a system that affects you in some way, giving you a reason to care.

- Trigger access violations
    > - While very common, it’s also useful to get a debug memory allocator that can do things like mark pages as invalid on free (to generate access violations on use after free), or add a guard page after a memory allocation (to cause access violations on memory overruns.) A good one of these can also keep around allocation information after free for debugging, such as the stack that freed memory, and track the number of allocations to detect leaks.

    mutex_foo.lock();

    try {
        if (!is_foo_processed) {
            is_foo_processed = true;

            // ...

            // Avoid deadlock on reentrant calls
            mutex_foo.unlock();
            do_foo();
            mutex_foo.lock();

            // ...
        }
    } catch(...) {
        is_foo_processed = false;
        mutex_foo.unlock();
        throw;
    }

    mutex_foo.unlock();
    ```
- loop until hang/deadlock
    > If you know what part of the code produces it, you iterate over it indefinitely in a debugger until it hangs, then once you notice the iteration has stopped you “step in” to the debugger. Then you run another script that dumps the current trace back for each existing thread. That should be enough to detect the lock normally.

    > - ask yourself "what would break if a context switch happens right here" for each line.
    > - if you can pinpoint the place where the bug occurs, trigger a SIGSEGV there and run the entire thing under Valgrind.
    > - Back on the N64, I updated the bit of code that swapped threads to write, to a ring buffer, the outgoing/incoming PCs, thread IDs and clock. Found tons of unexpected issues. In another thread you can print that or save it to disk or whatever. Or just wait till it crashes and read memory for it. Found the last crash bug with it. Meanwhile, a colleague took it, and drew color coded bars on the screen so we could see exactly what was taking the time.

### hardware timings

> - Replace entire modules with stubs that pretend to do the real thing, but actually do something completely trivial that can't be buggy.
> - Reading and writing (I/O) involves precise timing. [...] the low-level code that reads and writes has to do so according to a clock. [...] I noticed that we set the programmable timer on the PlayStation 1 to 1 kHz (1000 ticks/second) [...] I modified the load/save code to reset the programmable timer to its default setting (100 Hz) before accessing the memory card, then put it back to 1 kHz afterwards.

1. [TonYApplicationMaster has race condition where thread is interrupted while flush is happening · Issue \#157 · tony\-framework/TonY · GitHub](https://github.com/tony-framework/TonY/issues/157)
    - `.close()` internally calls `.flush()`, exception thrown when `interrupt()` happens during the `.flush()`
2. [Fix race condition where thread is interrupted while flush is in progress by erwa · Pull Request \#158 · tony\-framework/TonY · GitHub](https://github.com/tony-framework/TonY/pull/158)
    - move `dataFileWriter.close()` call into the `stop()` method, after the event handler thread has terminated.

    > This test ensures that when `interrupt()` is called, the EventHandler thread is not calling `dataFileWriter.close()`. In order to have a reproducable test and avoid flakyness, we mock the following methods to ensure the order and timming of the race condition:
    > - `dataFileWriter.close()` is locked on a latch until an `interrupt()` is sent, if that interrupt happens inside this call, it will cause an assertion fail;
    > - `interrupt()` unlocks that latch after executing the real implementation;

### confusing size of buffer with size of structure

> - Function a() called function b(). When function b() returned, a local variable in function a() had changed from 0 to 1. "Aha!" you say. "You're smashing the stack! Function b() is writing outside its stack frame." But function b() was provably not doing that.

> - Function b() called msgrcv(), which has a very badly designed API. It takes a pointer to a structure, and a size parameter. The structure is supposed to be a type field (long), and then a buffer (array of char). The size parameter is supposed to be the size of the buffer, not the size of the structure. The original code that implemented this came from a contractor, and they made the very natural mistake of putting the size of the whole structure in the size field. This meant that an extra long was read from the message queue, and smashed the stack.

> - But that should mess up the stack from from function b(). How did it mess up a variable in function a()? Well, the compiler put that variable in a register, not on the stack. So when b() was called, it had to save off the registers it was going to use, so a()'s local variable wound up in b()'s stack frame.

### segv on invalid breakpoints

> - This occurs when gdb sets breakpoints on various probe events in the dynamic loader. The probe event locations are exported from ld.so as SDT markers, but gdb needs to know whether ARM or Thumb instructions are being exported at each marker so that it can insert the appropriate breakpoint instruction sequence. It does this by mapping the probe location to a function symbol (see arm_pc_is_thumb in gdb/arm-tdep.c), and using the target address of the symbol to determine if the function is called in Thumb or ARM more (bit 0 of the target address will be set for Thumb mode).

> - The problem here is that gdb can't map any of the probes to a symbol if the debug symbols aren't installed, and arm_pc_is_thumb returns false in this case (indicating ARM instructions).

### nested symbol lookups unconditionally reset register restoration

```
commit 84088310ce06bfc5759b37f0cd043dce80f578b6
Author: Ulrich Drepper <drepper@redhat.com>
Date:   Tue Aug 25 10:42:30 2009 -0700

    Handle AVX saving on x86-64 in interrupted smbol lookups.

    If a signal arrived during a symbol lookup and the signal handler also
    required a symbol lookup, the end of the lookup in the signal handler reset
    the flag whether restoring AVX/SSE registers is needed.  Resetting means
    in this case that the tail part of the outer lookup code will try to
    restore the registers and this can fail miserably.  We now restore to the
    previous value which makes nesting calls possible.

### socket leaks

> - Netty has a boss thread that accepts incoming connections and assigns each successfully-opened socket to a single particular I/O thread.

> - Each I/O thread runs an infinite loop that repeatedly waits for activity on its assigned sockets (using epoll/kqueue/select) and runs each received TCP segment through our Netty pipeline on that thread.

> - Usually when an I/O thread writes to one of its own sockets, the write takes place synchronously. However, crucially, it may defer at least part of the write until later, for example if the kernel’s buffer is full. The write would then be performed on a later loop when the selector (epoll/kqueue/select) reports that the socket is ready for writing.

> - We were writing to a channel and then blocking on the result Future to see if it succeeded. Since we were writing from the I/O thread, the write would usually be performed synchronously so the returned future would already be complete and the application would continue. However, sometimes the write wouldn’t fully complete and the future could not be completed until the next time around the selector loop. But the I/O thread was blocked, so the loop couldn’t proceed, so the future would never complete.

> - Since the I/O thread was stuck, it couldn’t respond to any further messages from any of its managed sockets. Eventually the client would give up and send a FIN segment, and the kernel’s TCP/IP stack would put the socket in the CLOSE_WAIT state. Usually the I/O thread handles this in its worker loop by calling close on the socket, but it was stuck so this code never ran and the socket would never close.

> - The boss thread was still running, so the system continued to accept new connections and assign some of them to the stuck I/O thread.

### non-compliant implementations

> - When BIND started, it would take our root hints, load them into it's cache, and begin to perform AAAA queries for the root servers. One of the upstream servers would respond with 0 records, the other would respond with NXDOMAIN. The server that responded with NXDOMAIN, would subsequently get deleted from our BIND servers cache, and would no longer be used as a root.

> - The next question was why?

> - After some sleuthing through the DNS RFCs, I eventually found the answer. There are two ways for a DNS server to return that an answer to a query doesn't exist. Returning 0 records, and returning NXDOMAIN, and they have slightly different meaning. Returning 0 records, means that the label (think example.cm) exists, but the type of record does not (AAAA doesn't exist, but A/SRV/TXT/etc might). Returning NXDOMAIN means the the label doesn't exists, for any type of record, so don't bother querying me again for a different record type (There may have been some vagueness around this, I don't remember).

> The second discovery, is that we had a typo in our configuration, what we configured as the name of that root server, didn't match what our GRX provider had configured, which is why we were getting NXDOMAIN on one but not all servers we had configured as our roots.

> - The next question was why were our old servers working? This typo was actually duplicated from our older servers... which still worked during that outage.

> - So using my simulation, I tested every version of BIND released across something like a 3 year period, until I found it. Older version of BIND interpreted NXDOMAIN the same as 0 record answer, and at some point, I can only assume they fixed a bug, that updated this interpretation of NXDOMAIN.

### shellcmd

[Can&\#39;t open file \(win gvim\) · Issue \#48 · mattn/vim\-gist · GitHub](https://github.com/mattn/gist-vim/issues/48)

This is not a permissions problem, and windows DOES in fact unset read-only. It's just a GUI bug that it thinks the bit is set. If you don't believe me, bring up the command prompt, cd to where the folder is, then do: dir /a:r. The folder you turned read-only off will not appear, because it really IS off.

The problem is really with the system() call. Just doing this from within vim will reproduce it:

```
:echo system("echo hi")
```

The problem is because some shell like cygwin shell is being used. I put these commands at the top of my `_vimrc` file to solve the problem:

```
set shell=cmd
set shellcmdflag=/c
```

This problem is solved now. I am not certain why this fixes it, because it seems like a race condition where the tmp file is created and closed before the process is done using it. The tmp file is in fact created successfully (I saw this with procmon), but it is closed/deleted before it's truely done with it.
