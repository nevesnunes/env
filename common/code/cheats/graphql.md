# overview

![graphql.png](./files/graphql.png)

- data in a graph structure (versus by resources)
- one interface (versus multiple endpoints)
- type system
    - for each node an object type
- entrypoints
    - query
    - mutation

> Data exposed to the API is represented by a graph where objects are represented by nodes and relationships between these objects are described by edges.  GraphQL is a RESTful API and more: a type system defines all queryable data on one endpoint.  There is no mapping between functions implemented on the server and HTTP methods. Each object is backed by a resolver. The resolver is responsible for accessing the serverâ€™s data.
