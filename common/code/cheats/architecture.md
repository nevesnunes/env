# Scalability

- pageviews per minute
    - upper bounds - most visited sites - e.g. wikipedia
- database server in separate host

# Configuration

### Overriding

1. Run-control files under /etc (or at fixed location elsewhere in systemland): What will most users on this system want most of the time? What will this particular user want most of the time?
2. System-set environment variables: How should this session (i.e., a potentially large series of related executions) be tailored?
3. Run-control files (or ‘dotfiles’) in the user's home directory.
4. User-set environment variables.
5. Switches and arguments passed to the program on the command line that invoked it: What is most useful for this particular run?

### Substitution

- `envsubst`: replace variables in stream
