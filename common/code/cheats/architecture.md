# Scalability

- pageviews per minute
    - upper bounds - most visited sites - e.g. wikipedia
- database server in separate host

# RESTful API

- Client-server model — a client requests data from a separated server, often over a network
- Uniform interface — all clients and servers interact with the API in the same way (e.g., multiple resource endpoints)
- Layered system — a client doesn't have to be connected to the end server
- Statelessness — a client holds the state between requests and responses
- Cacheability — a client can cache a server's reponse

# Configuration

### Overriding

1. Run-control files under /etc (or at fixed location elsewhere in systemland): What will most users on this system want most of the time? What will this particular user want most of the time?
2. System-set environment variables: How should this session (i.e., a potentially large series of related executions) be tailored?
3. Run-control files (or ‘dotfiles’) in the user's home directory.
4. User-set environment variables.
5. Switches and arguments passed to the program on the command line that invoked it: What is most useful for this particular run?

### Substitution

- `envsubst`: replace variables in stream

# Naming

- [NetworkInterfaceNames \- Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkInterfaceNames)

# Privileges

- unix-domain sockets: SCM_CREDENTIALS, SO_PEERCRED
- pkexec
    > The thing with setuid/setgid is that the invoked privileged process inherits a lot of implicit state and context that people aren't really aware of or fully understand. i.e. it's not just env vars and argv[], it's cgroup memberships, audit fields, security contexts, open fds, child pids, parent pids, cpu masks, IO/CPU scheduling priorities, various prctl() settings, tty control, signal masks + handlers, … and so on. And it's not even clear what gets inherited as many of these process properties are added all the time.
    > If you do privileged execution of specific operations via IPC you get the guarantee that whatever is done, is done from a well-defined, pristine execution environment, without leaking context implicitly. The IPC message is the *full* vulnerable surface, and that's as minimal as it can get. And that's great.
