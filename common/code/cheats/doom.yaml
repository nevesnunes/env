   a very reliable vanilla-compatible way is to use a cacodemon in the bottom of a pit. It will float upwards with a constant speed, if you need it to spend more time before opening a door, just put some m1 teleporter lines to reset the cacodemon back down into the pit.
sound: |-
  add sectors to monster batteries which are joined/merged with a sector in the map

  However, sound tunnels can still have use cases for staged fights where you can start with closed tunnels and slowly open them up to gradually activate monsters, rather than having them go all at once.
bugs: falling on a floor with -32768 height will cause anything on it to infinitely fall through and teleport to the top of the ceiling in Vanilla Doom.
