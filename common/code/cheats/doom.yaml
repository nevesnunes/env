    romero rules: |-
      - Always changing floor height when I wanted to change floor textures.
      - Using special border textures between different wall segments and doorways.
      - Being strict about texture alignment.
      - Conscious use of contrast everywhere in a level between light and dark areas, cramped and open areas.
      - Making sure that if a player could see outside that they should be able to somehow get there.
      - Being strict about designing several secret areas on every level.
      - Making my levels flow so the player will revisit areas several times so they will better understand the 3D space of the level.
      - Creating easily recognizable landmarks in several places for easier navigation.

   a very reliable vanilla-compatible way is to use a cacodemon in the bottom of a pit. It will float upwards with a constant speed, if you need it to spend more time before opening a door, just put some m1 teleporter lines to reset the cacodemon back down into the pit.
sound: |-
  add sectors to monster batteries which are joined/merged with a sector in the map

  However, sound tunnels can still have use cases for staged fights where you can start with closed tunnels and slowly open them up to gradually activate monsters, rather than having them go all at once.
bugs: falling on a floor with -32768 height will cause anything on it to infinitely fall through and teleport to the top of the ceiling in Vanilla Doom.
