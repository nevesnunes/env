```

Selection Sort
    go through array, updating minimum
    switch minimum with last ordered index+1

```c
selection_sort(int s[], int n) {
    int i,j; /* counters */
    int min; /* index of minimum */
    for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
        min=i;
        for (j=i+1; j<n; j++)
            if (s[j] < s[min]) min=j;
        swap(&s[i],&s[min]);
    }
}
```

```
S(n) = Sum(from: i=0, to: n-1, body:
    Sum(from: j=i+1, to: n-1, body: 1)
) =
Sum(from: i=0, to: n-1, body: n-i-1) =
n(n-1)/2

S(n) <= n(n-1) = O(n^2)
S(n) >= (n/2)(n/2) = Omega(n^2)
```

Insertion Sort
    compare current index with last ordered index
        if smaller
            switch
                then current index + 1
        else
            last ordered index - 1 until beginning
                then current index + 1

Bubble Sort
    pairwise compare indexes
        if smaller is last index
            switch
    last element will be ordered
        then loop for length - 1
    => use bool for swapped (stop condition)
    :) Good for seeing already sorted

Merge Sort
    Subdivide list
        Merge each sub list
            copy both sub lists into helper array
            compare one index from each sub list
                if index of sub list -lt other index, then assign to original array
    :) Good for single linked lists (only +1 extra space)
    :) Access contiguous memory locations
    :) Parallelization

Heap Sort
    heapify => ensuring child is smaller than parent
    Extract maximum from heap
        Redo heapify

Quick Sort
    ```python
    def quickSort(arr, left, right):
        if left < right:
            pivot = partition(arr, left, right)
            quickSort(arr, left, pivot - 1)
            quickSort(arr, pivot, right)
        return arr
    def partition(arr, left, right):
        pivot = arr[(left + right) // 2]
        while left <= right:
            while arr[left] < pivot: left += 1
            while arr[right] > pivot: right -= 1
            if left <= right:
                (arr[left], arr[right]) = (arr[right], arr[left])
                left += 1
                right -= 1
        return left
    ```
    1-pivot vs. dual-pivot
        https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#sort(byte[])

Counting sort
    index array (length = largest value) -> store counts of each index
    loop index array -> pos i+1 = value i + value i+1
    output array -> loop initial array from end
        i value -> lookup index array = i value
            output-index = value-1 in index-array
            output-value = index in index-array
    :) eliminate duplicates

Radix sort
    :) O(kn) can be better than O(n log(n)), n = count_elements, k = count_passes

# Binary Search

```java
Collections.sort(list, Collections.reverseOrder());
// Output: [E, D, C, B, A]

int index = Collections.binarySearch(list, "D", Collections.reverseOrder());
// Output: 1
```

# Trees

binary tree - each node has up to 2 children
binary search tree - ordered
    ```
    foreach node n, left_descedents <= n < right_descendents
    ```
    ? duplicates cases: unsupported, left ordered or right ordered
complete binary tree - each level is filled, with optional rightmost children in last level missing
full binary tree - each node has 0 or 2 children
perfect binary tree - full and complete

```c
// traversal
void preOrderTraversal(TreeNode node) {
    if (node != null) {
        // preOrder
        visit(node);
        preOrderTraversal(node.left);
        // inOrder
        // visit(node);
        preOrderTraversal(node.right);
        // postOrder
        // visit(node);
    }
}
```

### binary heaps

min-heap - each node is smaller than children
max-heap - each node is larger than children

```java
public class MaxComparator implements Comparator<Integer> {
    public int compare( Integer x, Integer y ) {
        return y - x;
    }
}
PriorityQueue maxHeap = new PriorityQueue(size, new MaxComparator());
```

insert()
    at rightmost bottom position, ensuring complete tree property
    swap new node with parent, until ensuring min-heap property
    O(log n)
extract_minimum()
    remove root node
    move bottommost rightmost node to root
    swap new root node with smallest child, until ensuring min-heap property
    O(log n)

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/min-heap-in-java/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/min-heap-in-python/

### trie

stores words where shared prefixes share same parents
find()
    O(k), k = length of prefix

https://github.com/naskitis/B-trie

### balanced trees

ensures O(log n) runtime for insert() and find()
    ! left and right subtrees could have diff sizes

balancing
```c
link balanceR(link h) {
  if (h->N < 2)
    return h;
  h = partR(h, h->N/2);
  h->l = balanceR(h->l);
  h->r = balanceR(h->r);
  return h;
}
```
```java
// Traverse the skewed binary tree and stores its nodes pointers in vector nodes[]
void storeBSTNodes(Node root, Vector<Node> nodes)  {
    if (root == null)
        return;

    // Store nodes inorder (= sorted order for BST)
    storeBSTNodes(root.left, nodes);
    nodes.add(root);
    storeBSTNodes(root.right, nodes);
}
Node buildTree(List<Node> nodes, int start, int end) {
    if (start > end)
        return null;

    // Get the middle element and make it root
    int mid = (start + end) / 2;
    Node node = nodes.get(mid);

    // Using index inorder, construct left and right subtrees
    node.left = buildTreeUtil(nodes, start, mid - 1);
    node.right = buildTreeUtil(nodes, mid + 1, end);

    return node;
}
```

validating heights
```java
public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null)
        return true;
    if (getHeight(root) == -1)
        return false;
    return true;
}
public int getHeight(TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null)
        return 0;
    int left = getHeight(root.left);
    int right = getHeight(root.right);
    if (left == -1 || right == -1)
        return -1;
    if (Math.abs(left - right) > 1) {
        return -1;
    }
    return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
}
```
https://www.programcreek.com/2013/02/leetcode-balanced-binary-tree-java/

B-tree
    structure fully in memory
    :) performant caching - consider cache line sizes (or VM pages)

AVL
    diff height between children -lt 2

Red-Black
    :( keeping the colour in every tree node bloats the data – quite probably by 8 bytes for the struct size on a modern machine, and many malloc libraries round up to the next multiple or 16 or 32 bytes

scapegoat tree
    :) vs. red-black - requires only a few bytes of extra global storage (for powers of your acceptable unbalance factor)

R-tree
    indexing multi-dimensional information such as geographical coordinates, rectangles or polygons

# Graphs

storing
    adjacency matrix - read order = row-column
    adjacency list ~= hash table where hash() = node id

marking
    white = un-visited
    grey = visited
    black = finished (no more children to visit)

back edge = points to gray node
forward edge = points to black node

Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    use case - path between two nodes (quicker for less deep paths)
    => bidirectional search (BFS started from both nodes)
        O(k^d) vs. O(2*k^(d/2)), k = count_adjacent_nodes, d = path_length
    ```cpp
    void search(Node root, int current_time = 0) {
        Queue q = new Queue();
        q.enqueue(root);
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            Node r = q.dequeue();
            visit(r);
            r.visited = true;
            r.visit_time = current_time + 1;
            for (Node n : r.adjacent) {
                if (n.visited == false) {
                    q.enqueue(n);
                }
            }
            r.finished = true;
            r.finish_time = current_time + 1;
        }
    }
    ```
    O(V+E)

Depth-First Search (DFS)
    use case - visit every node
    ```cpp
    void search(Node root, int current_time = 0) {
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }
        visit(root);
        root.visited = true;
        root.visit_time = current_time + 1;
        for (Node n : root.adjacent) {
            if (n.visited == false) {
                search(n, current_time);
            }
        }
        root.finished = true;
        root.finish_time = current_time + 1;
    }
    ```

Topologic Ordering
    ! requires DAG
    method 1 - reverse order from DFS => when node marked as finished, add as head of linked list
    method 2 - vertice elimination
    ```c
    Queue order = new Queue()
    Queue processNext = new Queue()
    for (Node n : graph.nodes) {
        for (Node x : n.adjacent) {
            x.inbound++;
        }
    }
    for (Node n : graph.nodes) {
        if (n.inbound == 0) {
            processNext.queue(n)
        }
    }
    while (!processNext.isEmpty()) {
        Node n = processNext.dequeue();
        for (Node x : n.adjacent) {
            x.inbound--
            if (x.inbound == 0) {
                processNext.queue(x)
            }
        }
        order.queue(n)
    }
    ```

Tarjan
    identify SCCs (u->v and v->u) (solves 2-SAT)
    uses back+forward edges for identifying cycles
    low[u] = min(low[u], low[v]), v is adjacent node

Kruskal
    identify MST (minimum spanning tree -> edges than connect all vertices)
    sort edges by weight
    check edge
        if vertices from different sets, then join sets
        else skip (it's a cycle)
    O(E lg E)

Prim
    keep track of joined nodes in a single tree
    for remaining neighbour edges
        if edge links two vertices already in tree
            skip
        else
            add to tree

Dijkstra
    shortest paths with non-negative edges
    maintain priority queue (e.g. min-heap) with nodes to visit - impl. TreeSet
        [!] use unique id instead of edge value for TreeSet `compareTo()`
    ```
    add nodes to priority queue
    while priority queue is not empty
        node n = queue.pollFirst() // extractMin
        update neighbours
            if (d + edge value < d of neighbour) {
                d of neighbour = d + edge value // relax
                if (neighbour in queue) {
                    queue.remove(neighbour)
                    queue.add(neighbour) // decreaseKey
                }
                predecessor of neighbour = n
            }

        > To add to this, libraries aren't consistent about convention either. Take the common "RGBA". Is this describing the byte order? Or describing most-significant to least-significant 0xRRGGBBAA, which might be little-endian encoded into a "ABGR" byte order? If you think that's stupid idea and that I'm an idiot for suggesting it, what about 16-bit RGB formats where the G component straddles both bytes? Okay, so those aren't so common anymore - but what about DXT/BC compressed formats which encode 4x4 pixel chunks at a time, and don't cleanly decompose into "channels" in the first place?
        > D3DFMT_A8R8G8B8 (Direct3D 9) is equivalent to DXGI_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_UNORM (DXGI / Direct3D 10+). Note that one enumeration lists the components in reverse order of the other, and that this is correct! https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d10/d3... .
        > Documentation often completely omits information endian or encoding - and when it doesn't, it's often hidden away where you'll never find it, and usually assumes x86/x64/little-endian processors. The behavior on big-endian machines is best found out through testing - even if the documentation is clear, the documentation stands a good chances of lying, and CI probably doesn't test on big-endian meaning bugs have likely arisen, and there's a good chance your copy of the library is old and doesn't contain any bugfixes.
        > In light of all of the above, RGB vs BGR confusion is one of the most natural points of confusion to run across when dealing with image formats. "Just use the type system!" ignores where these bugs crop up - (de)serialization, converting streams of bytes to types or vicea versa. Someone must write the code, declaration, whatever - and the type system has no means of ensuring that correctly matches whatever not-computer-readable spec that the (de)serialization is supposed to match - and so it will, frequently, be understandably incorrect.
- ring buffer wraparound

        > Periodically, the client I was not actively using would stop receiving messages, although it could still send data successfully.
        > Hubfs uses ring-buffer type data structures, and the logic for handling "wrap around" is tricky. The bug is occurring when multiple readers' requests are stored at the maximum end of the queue, wraparound happens, and then their requests are forgotten.

        > Rather than having complex logic changing the pattern the mail carrier walks, it was much simpler to "change the numbers on the boxes" and copy the pointers from the end of the message queue to the beginning. That way, no extra variables or variant message-answering loops were needed.
    - what if there's double wraparound? won't k messages in the 2nd wraparound overwrite the first k messages in the 1st wraparound?
