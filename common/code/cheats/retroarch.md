# Enable Analog Sticks

There are two distinctive ways. One method enables the dual analog for games that support the dual analog(like Ape Escape). The other method simply mirrors the dpad controls onto the joystick.

Method One: Get into the Retroarch GUI from in-game with select+X(top button). Navigate to Quick Menu -> Core Options. Set Pad 1 Type to analog. No need to save on exit.

Method Two: Get into RGUI again. Navigate to Quick Menu -> Core Input Options. Set User 1 Analog to Digital Type to Left Analog. Save core or game remap file.

Make sure if you want to use both methods depending on the game that you only set your Analog to Digital Type on a per game basis because it has conflicts with the other method. If you find yourself with an older game that doesn't function at all in analog mode, go back an switch Method One to standard.
